						<h2 class="border-bottom__full">What is residential conveyancing?</h2>
						<p>Conveyancing involves legally transferring home ownership from the seller to the buyer. So you’ll need the services of a residential conveyancer if you are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Buying a new home</li>
							<li>Selling your home</li>
							<li>Transferring ownership on death</li>
							<li>Transferring ownership due to divorce or separation</li>
							<li>Transferring ownership as a gift</li></li>
							<li>Your conveyancer will also complete the remortgage transaction and discharge your mortgage once it has been repaid</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2 class="border-bottom__full">Residential conveyancing when buying your home</h2>
						<p>Buying your home can be a complex process. Whether you’re a first time buyer, are looking for a bigger property to meet the needs of a growing family, or are even looking to downsize - you’re going to need a conveyancer. For most people, their home is their biggest asset so you’ll want to make sure your next move is the right move.</p>
						<p>Our legal team can help you with all the legal aspects of buying your home including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Speaking to your mortgage lender</li>
							<li>Completing your transfer documents</li>
							<li>Preparing your loan documents</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Our Estate Agency team can also support you in areas such as noting interest in a property, arranging a survey and negotiating offers.</p>

						<h2 class="border-bottom__full">Residential conveyancing when selling your home</h2>
						<p>Selling your home comes with as much, if not more, paperwork than buying a new home. Luckily, we’re here to make the process as easy and straightforward as possible.</p>
						<p>Let us help you with all the important aspects of selling your home, including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Creating a tailored marketing strategy to increase exposure and reach potential buyers</li>
							<li>Offering advice on any offers you receive, negotiating the price and date of entry, plus any conditions specific to the sale</li>
							<li>Issuing an acceptance on your behalf, which protects your best interests and arranging to have the contract of sale binding on both parties</li>
							<li>Completing all the searches, preparing the transfer documents and answering any questions raised by the buyers’ solicitors</li>
							<li>Arranging for the repayment of your mortgage – both in terms of establishing how much is outstanding and making sure the balance is paid when the transaction is completed</li>
							<li>Settling the transaction, which involves letting your Council Tax Office know of the change of ownership and sending the proceeds of the sale direct to you</li>
						</ul>
